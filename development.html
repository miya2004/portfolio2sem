            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>To start, I'm going to start <span class="hover-text" id="btnBrainstorming">brainstorming</span> and write down everything that I can think of that will fit for the event website. After that I made a <span class="hover-text" id="btnMoscow">Moscow</span> </p> so me and Aleksa would have devide the ideas into what we will do for sure, what if we have time and what we won't do.Next step was <span class="hover-text" id="btnProjectPlan">Project plan</span> and <span class="hover-text" id="btnTrello">Trello</span> that helped us devide the work and also helped with time managment.

                  </div>
                <p>I had an assignment to complete the project plan first, but I started with brainstorming because I wanted to have everything prepared for the project plan. Since I had a photo booth as a product in the last project and needed to use something from our previous project, I initially thought about creating a landing page with a Blender-made photo booth. The idea was that when you click the buy button, an animation would print your ticket with photos on the back. However, unsure if Aleksa and I would have enough time, we explored other ideas.
                    The AI vision concept was our second choice. Given that the band's motto is "escape from reality," Aleksa and I considered creating a website that looks like AI vision. However, we needed to focus more on the event rather than the band's website itself.
                    I continued brainstorming other ideas while keeping in mind that we could still incorporate AI vision for the event website. For the Easter egg, I wanted something clickable, like a game. When you find the egg, for example, it would start dancing. I chose an egg because the group started in a chicken coop.
                    Aleksa and I also wanted to do something with Blender and learn how to implement it in the website. I suggested creating a gallery room in Blender for the "About Us" section, combining these two ideas. Other ideas included a counter, location page, ticket purchasing section, frequently asked questions, and footer.</p>

                  </div>
                <p>The MoSCoW table was easy to create because we already had a vision of how the website should look. After brainstorming, I just had to place the ideas in the right categories. We put in "Must Have" the elements that every event website has and the features we knew we could implement in the given time frame. In "Should Have," we included additional desirable features. The spotify preview and the number of bought tickets we putted in could have because it was not really needed and if we had time we would have do it. We put language switch and sign up profile in "Won't Have because we found it unnecessary and also we were thinking like that because of the interviews .".</p>

            <div class="hover-card" id="showProjectPlan">

                <p>Every project must have a project plan, so after organizing everything and having a clear idea of what we wanted, we started with the project plan on the second day. I followed the template for the project plan and added a timeline with daily to-do tasks rather than weekly ones because I wanted to show what we planned to do each day.<a href="projectplandev.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the project plan</a></p>

                  </div>
                <p>The Trello board really helped me because it provides a clear plan of what needs to be done each day. Adding deadlines motivates you more than saying "we have time." I used a color-coded agenda, which I found effective in previous first-semester team projects. I also assigned tasks so Aleksa and I knew what we would do individually, avoiding duplication of effort. However, plans don't always go as expected. I was sick on Thursday and Friday and couldn't do anything, so we started coding late and had to adjust the Trello board to ensure I could complete everything on time.</p>

        <div id="inspiration" class="section">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The designing part went quite well in my opinion, first I started by doing <span class="hover-text" id="btnCompetitoranalysis">competitor analysis</span> then furthermore I continued with <span class="hover-text" id="btnInterview">interview</span> to see what features do users want to see most and then I started <span class="hover-text" id="btnPrototype">the prototype</span> in Canva (I know that is better to prototype in Figma but I wanted to try with Canva too) and for finalizing I <span class="hover-text" id="btnUserTest">user test</span> it with my friends and techers to adjust any details and have the final version of the prototype </p>

                  </div>
                <p>For analysis, I examined websites like Ticketmaster, Imagine Dragons' website, and StubHub. In the photo, I circled everything that I would like to include in my website. These websites are for events and concerts, and there are several pieces of information that each of them includes. Ticketmaster is the most popular, and I got the design for the location and some ideas from there. They also had a countdown, which I made sure to include as well. Since our client's website is for one specific event, I didn't include categories or other tabs but rather included everything in one scrollable page for easier navigation.</p>

            <div class="hover-card" id="showInterview">
                <p>In my previous project, I felt I didn't conduct as many interviews as I wanted. For this project, I interviewed four people, asking questions that would help me with the website design. I highlighted everything that I planned to use in the website from these interviews. The interviews also helped me decide on the language for the website. I was considering both English and Dutch versions, but most interviewees said that nowadays, many people know English, so a Dutch version isn't really necessary. They also mentioned that there are extensions that can translate automatically. The interviewees emphasized that a counter and clear information for the event are important to have. No one specifically mentioned an Easter egg, though they agreed it would be nice to have.<a href="interview.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the interviews</a></p>

                  </div>
                <p>The design of the landing page was initially made by Aleksa, and I continued with the same theme. At first, as you can see, there was an egg inside the CD, which I planned to make the Easter egg. The idea was that when you click it, three options would pop up, and clicking the right one would give you a discount for their merch or concert ticket. After receiving feedback that it didn't need to be an actual Easter egg and that it should be connected with the band, I started thinking of something else.
                    In the second landing page version, you can see a "My Tickets" button, but because the website is for one event, it won't be necessary to have an account. The third version shows a portal in the first red CD that would lead you to buy tickets. However, after user testing, my teacher told me that the spinning CDs were distracting and that users would like to see more information before buying tickets, such as the location.
                    Our final landing page, which we later coded, features spinning CDs that focus your attention. When you click "Learn More," it leads you to the information. In the first version of the page, I planned to have a clickable content table, but it would be too complicated for the user, so the second version is a picture with information. The countdown is included, and then you have a "Get Your Tickets" button.
                    The next step was to visually incorporate their Instagram page. At first, I just added a picture of their Instagram, but later it didn't go as planned, and I created something else that wasn't prototyped. When scrolling through Canvas, I saw a gallery room and had the idea to make one in Blender. Then I added about us, location, and FAQ pages.</p>

                  </div>
                <p>I tested the website with 3 people and show it to techers. My UX friday techer told me that she would like before buying tickets there should be information first and to put the countdown more below because she would usually want to see the countdown after deciding if she will go and also "to buy tickets" option was in the landing page but because of the spinning circles she told me that she will be distracted and wont pay attenction a lot to the sign to buy a tickets so i thought she was right and put it in the countdown section, the other people got to test the newest version and they seemed to like it very much everything was structured but I got a comment that the date don't match and that the instagram post are not matching but i explained that the instagram post i wanted to use the instagram i remade for them and that the dates are just a mistake, also they said that the cds would be cool to have music or some kind of sound because just spinning around doesn't make sense. the user test really helped me and I found it really important to test it first and later on develop it because my friday techer really did have a point and it was a really helpful feedback later on I structured the website in easy way so the other users can have it easy using the event website</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed this project. With my last assesment I was told to do some interviews and to use the dot framework and I did but because the project was for development and I didn't want to waste much time in documentation I did 3-4 interviews, competitor analysis of most trendy websites and user testing so I can for sure know that the final product is food for the users, but for the development part it didn't go really as planned because I needed to do more things which I enjoyed but was really stressed out till the end. However I liked how the website turned out and also the client really liked the website he said there are a lot of interactions which is good and also enjoyed seeing his picture on the ticket part. What would I do the next time is making it responsive because I think that is important too and also I would design it more well.
