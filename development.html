            <p>For the Development project we were devided into groups of 2 so I was with Aleksa and we had to make a website for the Nasmak's upcoming event and we needed to add an easter egg</p>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

After that I made a <span class="hover-text" id="btnMoscow">Moscow</span>  so me and Aleksa would have devide the ideas into what we will do for sure, what if we have time and what we won't do.Next step was <span class="hover-text" id="btnProjectPlan">Project plan</span> and <span class="hover-text" id="btnTrello">Trello</span> that helped us devide the work and also helped with time managment.</p>

                      I had an assignment to complete the project plan first, but I started with brainstorming because I wanted to have everything prepared for the project plan. Since I had a photo booth as a product in the last project and needed to use something from our previous project, I initially thought about creating a landing page with a Blender-made photo booth.The AI vision concept was our second choice. Given that the band's motto is "escape from reality," Aleksa and I considered creating a website that looks like AI vision. However, we needed to focus more on the event rather than the band's website itself. I continued brainstorming other ideas while keeping in mind that we could still incorporate AI vision for the event website.

                  </div>
                <p>The MoSCoW table was easy to create because we already had a vision of how the website should look. After brainstorming, I just had to place the ideas in the right categories. We put in "Must Have" the elements that every event website has and the features we knew we could implement in the given time frame. In "Should Have," we included additional desirable features. The spotify preview and the number of bought tickets we putted in could have because it was not really needed and if we had time we would have do it. We put language switch and sign up profile in "Won't Have because we found it unnecessary and also we were thinking like that because of the interviews.</p>

                <p>Every project must have a project plan, so after organizing everything and having a clear idea of what we wanted, we started with the project plan on the second day. I followed the template for the project plan and added a timeline with daily to-do tasks rather than weekly ones because I wanted to show what we planned to do each day.<a href="projectplandev.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the project plan</a></p>

                <p>The Trello board really helped me because it provides a clear plan of what needs to be done each day. Adding deadlines motivates you more than saying "we have time." I used a color-coded agenda, which I found effective in previous first-semester team projects. I also assigned tasks so Aleksa and I knew what we would do individually, avoiding duplication of effort. However, plans don't always go as expected. I was sick on Thursday and Friday and couldn't do anything, so we started coding late and had to adjust the Trello board to ensure I could complete everything on time.</p>

                        <p>For analysis, I examined websites like Ticketmaster, Imagine Dragons' website, and StubHub. In the photo, I circled everything that I would like to include in my website. These websites are for events and concerts, and there are several pieces of information that each of them includes. Ticketmaster is the most popular, and I got the design for the location and some ideas from there. They also had a countdown, which I made sure to include as well. Since our client's website is for one specific event, I didn't include categories or other tabs but rather included everything in one scrollable page for easier navigation</p>

                        <p>In my previous project, I felt I didn't conduct as many interviews as I wanted. For this project, I interviewed four people, asking questions that would help me with the website design. I highlighted everything that I planned to use in the website from these interviews. The interviews also helped me decide on the language for the website. I was considering both English and Dutch versions, but most interviewees said that nowadays, many people know English, so a Dutch version isn't really necessary. They also mentioned that there are extensions that can translate automatically. The interviewees emphasized that a counter and clear information for the event are important to have. No one specifically mentioned an Easter egg, though they agreed it would be nice to have.<a href="interview.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the interviews</a> </p>

                    <p>I tested the website with 3 people and show it to techers. My UX friday techer told me that she would like before buying tickets there should be information first and to put the countdown more below because she would usually want to see the countdown after deciding if she will go and also "to buy tickets" option was in the landing page but because of the spinning circles she told me that she will be distracted and wont pay attenction a lot to the sign to buy a tickets so i thought she was right and put it in the countdown section, the other people got to test the newest version and they seemed to like it very much everything was structured but I got a comment that the date don't match and that the instagram post are not matching but i explained that the instagram post i wanted to use the instagram i remade for them and that the dates are just a mistake, also they said that the cds would be cool to have music or some kind of sound because just spinning around doesn't make sense. the user test really helped me and I found it really important to test it first and later on develop it because my friday techer really did have a point and it was a really helpful feedback later on I structured the website in easy way so the other users can have it easy using the event website </p>

                    <h4 class="green-headline">User test 2</h4>
                    <p>After the project ended, I conducted a user test with five people to ensure the website I created for the Nasmak PM Band was both interactive and user-friendly. My main goal was to make the website as enjoyable as possible for the target audience, ensuring they understood the structure and found it easy to use.<br><br>
                        For the first task, I gave them two versions of the website: one with the ticket customization option and one without. As they were scrolling and buying tickets, I noticed that when they reached the step to customize their tickets, they had big smiles. One of the testers, a 23-year-old woman who enjoys this type of music, even asked me to send her the customized ticket after the test. When they tested the version without this option, they mentioned that it felt like any other generic website and was more plain. This confirmed to me that the ticket customization feature added a unique, engaging element to the website.<br><br>
                        The second task focused on an "Easter egg" feature I had added to the event page. I wanted to see if users could understand why it was an Easter egg and how it was connected to the rest of the site. I first tested this feature with my manager, who enjoys similar music, but she didn’t immediately understand its purpose. I explained it to her, but my goal was to see if users could figure it out on their own. One user mentioned that if there was going to be an Easter egg, it would be better if it related more directly to the band or the event itself. He suggested something more obvious, like incorporating the band’s face or something related to their music. If I had more time with the project, I’d consider making something like a Pac-Man feature with the band’s face or an interactive element tied to their music.<br><br>
                        The third task was to test if users understood the website structure and if it was easy to navigate. During my first user test with my teacher Jo An, she told me that the website structure wasn’t very clear, and I needed to make some changes. After applying her feedback, I tested the revised version with my participants and found that most of them preferred the updated version. They appreciated that it wasn’t as cluttered and that the steps were more clearly defined. However, I received feedback about the Instagram section, where users didn’t understand it and suggested adding a headline to clarify that it was the Instagram section. They also didn’t understand the spinning CDs and expected them to play music.<br><br>
                        After gathering all this feedback, I realize that my new version of the website would look quite different, but I can now see how crucial these user tests are for refining the design. It’s been a valuable learning experience, and I now understand why it's important to have these steps in place before finalizing a project.

                        <p>The design of the landing page was initially created by Aleksa, and I continued working with the same theme. The first version of the page featured an egg inside a CD, which I intended to use as an interactive "easter egg." The idea was that when clicked, it would reveal three options, and selecting the correct one would provide a discount for merchandise or concert tickets. However, after receiving feedback that the design didn’t need to include a literal easter egg and should instead connect more closely with the band's identity, I began brainstorming alternative concepts.</p>

                        <p>In the second version of the landing page, I added a "My Tickets" button. However, since the website was designed for a single event, implementing an account system seemed unnecessary. By the third version, I integrated a red CD with a portal leading directly to ticket purchases. During user testing, my teacher pointed out that the spinning CDs were distracting, and users would prefer to see more relevant information—such as the event location—before proceeding to buy tickets.</p>

                <p>This feedback led to the final version of the landing page, which we later coded. The spinning CDs remained but were redesigned to focus user attention on them. A "Learn More" button was added, directing users to detailed event information. Initially, I had planned to include a clickable content table for easier navigation, but I ultimately decided it would be too complex for users. Instead, I opted for a simpler design featuring an image containing all the relevant details. Additionally, I incorporated a countdown feature and a prominent "Get Your Tickets" button to encourage action</p>

Me and Aleksa were brainstorming for the easter egg and at first we wanted it to be a game where you need to guess which egg is the winner at to get 30% discount but then because the band started in a chicken coop and their moto is "escape from reality" we decided to make a floating egg that you need to catch and when you do it cracks, its floating like you are floating in space</p>

I wanted from the start to have something going on with the photobooth but I didn't know what so after making the part to buy tickets I thought it will be a good idea to make it also a customizable. I started with thinking of how to design it and I made a seperate html file for it just to try things and not mess with the original html file for the nasmak pm website and it turned out pretty well in the seperate page but when I tried to include it in the event page the design was not as I wanted and I didn't have much time left to finish it but for the future I will manage my time better.</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed this project. With my last assesment I was told to do some interviews and to use the dot framework and I did but because the project was for development and I didn't want to waste much time in documentation I did 3-4 interviews, competitor analysis of most trendy websites and user testing so I can for sure know that the final product is food for the users, but for the development part it didn't go really as planned because I needed to do more things which I enjoyed but was really stressed out till the end. However I liked how the website turned out and also the client really liked the website he said there are a lot of interactions which is good and also enjoyed seeing his picture on the ticket part. What would I do the next time is making it responsive because I think that is important too and also I would design it more well.
