            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I was assigned an individual project, and I decided to design and develop a game because that's what I want to pursue in the future. Starting this project now feels like a small but important step toward achieving that goal. My game is inspired by Super Mario, with a theme that ties back to the design elements in my portfolio.</p>

            <p>From the start I knew I wanted to develop a game so I started looking for <span class="hover-text" id="btninspirations">inspirations</span>. The super-mario game was the first thing I looked and then I was watching more animation games so I can add more details. I didn't want to complicate the game a lot so I kept it simple. After doing my research I started showing my teacher to see if it's good enough.And then I began <span class="hover-text" id="btnprototype">prototyping</span> the game </p>

                        <p>My first thought when I wanted to do a game was to design it like a super mario game, so I started looking for more versions of the game and also animation games so I can take some things from them, it really helped me because I wanted to have my own colour palette for the game so looking at the inspirations helped me making the platforms </p>

                        <p>For the game prototype, I added a background using the two main colors of my portfolio and applied a color gradient to create it. The platform of the game, where the player steps or runs, was designed in Figma using rectangles and circles because I couldn't find a program to generate it automatically. The ice creams represent coins that the player must collect, while the bunnies serve as enemies that must be avoided.<a href="https://www.figma.com/design/laQ0VktWomqAnU5Io4ieT1/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=gnknSFiJJ9EmS3Ab-0" target="_blank">Click here to see figma</a>  </p>

            <p>For <span class="hover-text" id="btncode">coding</span> I didn't know how to start but I started watching <span class="hover-text" id="btnyoutube">youtube tutorials</span>, I was not able to follow the whole video because I had problems with some extensions so I started searching another way to make the platfrom into a html image. I then followed everything I learned and after trying many times and asking AI to see what are the errors I succeeded. I also had a errors for the platforms and I asked my teacher Mikael to help me. I had 3<span class="hover-text" id="btnjs">different js files</span> to test 3 different things and at the end I chose the one where everything was working and felt safe with it. I didn't finish everything but the things that must be done are there. Coding a game really can annoy you because a lot of things can happen and even a single word mistake can crash your whole game, that way after every single thing that I was adding I was checking and refreshing to see if its still working.
