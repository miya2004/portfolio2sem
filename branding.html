            <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My first project was for branding for the minor health innovation Fontys, our client wanted from me and my group to
            build a brand where different forms of communication are pulled
            together (videos, posters, PowerPoint presentations etc.) and to make a good promo video for marketing. They wanted to be seen as more interesting and fun minor and not boring so me and my group worked on to make a brand for them for the next 4 weeks.
            </p>

        <div id="inspiration" class="section">
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p> During the first week, I assist with the <span class="hover-text" id="btnproject plan">project plan</span>. This helped me set clear goals for the project, ensuring that all team members have a task in this project. Also, it helped me with organizing my future weeks and what should I do.
            After that I also helped with the <span class="hover-text" id="btncontentstrategy">content strategy</span> (mission,vision and brand statement) so the client can see what we will basically deliver and what is our vision for it. Furthermore I assist with the <span class="hover-text" id="btnplanning">teams planning</span> that helped me with deviding the work with small steps, basically what should we do every day and i suggested with doing it by weeks and also to use colors and to assign on every task people so it will be clear what everyone should do.
            >Next is the <span class="hover-text" id="btnteamcharter">teams charter</span> that helped me see what everyone's weaknesses is and strenght and it was more easy to devide the tasks.</p>

                <p>I contributed to developing our content strategy, for the message and concept I wanted to put “have fun while making a difference” so people can be more interested and not think of this study as a boring thing but as something interesting and enjoyable.
                For media I putted everything that we have done for the project as a media aspect </p>

                <p>Second week after getting sad feedback from Anke I did a planning in Trello that was moved to Teams because my teammates preferred it. I did it in weeks because that helped me and the others to have a clear vision of what we have to do and when. With every task, there were people assigned and deadlines too so we could have in mind when to start.</p>

                <p>First day I made a shared team charter so that everyone could write their details. I used a template from Canva. The team charter helped us assign the future tasks for the project</p>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>In the first week me and my group started doing <span class="hover-text" id="btnstylecapes">stylescapes</span> and at first I made it with Justin and Aleksa and later on we got a feedback to make an <span class="hover-text" id="btnindstylescape">individual style cape</span>. Based on my <span class="hover-text" id="btncompetitoranalysis">competitor analysis</span> that I made I end up combining everything from the websites and the ideas I had and I started with my <span class="hover-text" id="btnprototype">prototype</span> but after the first review the client got more ideas  and also made a <span class="hover-text" id="btnsurvey">survey</span>. My feedback was poor so I made <span class="hover-text" id="btnsurvey2">another survey</span> after the feedback I got from Frank
            </p>

                  </div>
                <p>To guide our design process, I created two style scapes: one with my teammates and another individually. Before doing the style scape, I researched what style scape should look like. Style scapes are visual representations that help define the aesthetic direction of a project.</p>

                <p>
                    Of course, I got feedback that I should not ask questions about the design because after all I am the one designing it and the client is trusting my perspective, that’s why I made another survey, but it was not used because the project already end. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMqI85hWx6R7EToyS5ouQgHIlBWbrAAj-0Vomlns0Nvy85BQ/viewform?usp=header" target="_blank">Click here to see the survey</a> 
                    <br>The questions are 10 and this is how they helped:<br><br>
                    
                    <br>1.	This helps us know where students hear about the minor, so we can talk about it in the right places.
                    <br>2.	This shows how well students already know about the minor, so we can figure out if we need to explain it better.
                    <br>3.	This tells us what students like most in a program, so we can make sure it matches their interests.
                    <br>4.	This helps us find out what makes the minor special for students, so we can show why it’s a great choice.
                    <br>5.	This lets us know if students like the current ads or if we need to make them more interesting.
                    <br>6.	This helps us see what kind of things—like videos or posters—students enjoy most, so we can use those to tell them about the minor.
                    <br>7.	This tells us where students like to get information, like Instagram or email, so we can post it where they’ll see it.
                    <br>8.	This shows how often we should send updates, so students don’t miss out but also don’t feel overwhelmed.
                    <br>9.	This helps us learn what makes the minor stand out, so we can tell everyone what’s great about it.
                    <br>10.	This gives us ideas from students to make the minor more fun and exciting.

                  <p>Color and Typography Choices: For my style scape, I chose colors that resonate with our project's theme. Blue was selected for its association with doctor uniforms, while grey reflects nurse uniforms. Black and white were used for text to ensure clarity. For typography, I opted for fonts that enhance readability and lend a professional appearance to the design rather than childish.</p>

                        <p>Overall, the analysis helped me create the website prototype for the client. I chose to focus on both tech inspirations and healthcare, as my assignment was to develop branding. I didn't want to alter their structure of studying, so all the information in the prototype comes from Fonty's website and Bart's Hospital.<br><br>

                        I have circled the elements I used in my prototype in red. For more detailed information, you can refer to my PDF document.
