                    <p>With my research and survey results, I began designing our website. A hero image was placed to align with the project's theme. I sourced information from Fontys' website for the content, including a page dedicated to project ideas that could help new students brainstorm. Later in the third week, I made the website interactive because my group decided to not proceed with creating an actual website and instead to show them an interactive one.

                    Inspiration from Other Websites: In looking for inspiration for our website design, I analyzed several existing websites. Barts Hospital's website particularly stood out as an exemplary model that influenced my design approach. <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/AnQtTBcApFK57MJ2fg3VYP/Untitled-(Copy)?t=Nlb0ukIV9GTovkEv-0" target="_blank">Click here for figma prototype</a>

                    <p>For the second semester, I wanted to create a prototype that was very different from my previous one. I started by thinking about things I enjoy. The first prototype had a matcha theme, but I found that I didn’t have much to add beyond just pouring matcha. I wanted a theme that would allow me to include various developments, so I decided to go with an animation theme instead.

                        When I began prototyping, I tested it with my teachers and asked for their opinions. One of the first pieces of feedback I received from Jo An was to leave space in the learning outcomes for explanations and reflections. Initially, I planned for the Learning Outcomes (LO) page to contain only photos and links to my work, with explanations on the projects page. However, since there were things I did outside of those projects, I added buttons with hover-card functionality to the LO page.
                        
                        I also wanted to learn how to use Blender, so I created a 3D room that represents my space back in Bulgaria. To make it more interactive, I included elements like a Kirby face and parallax zoom effects. For the parallax zoom, I liked the idea of having a train, but when my drawing didn’t turn out well, I decided to use another picture instead. Although my logo is not yet on the online website or in the prototype, I've chosen to use my designed logo instead of just my name or initials.
                        
                        Reflecting on this process, I initially didn’t understand the importance of prototyping and often started directly with the online website. Now, I've realized how helpful it is to have a prototype because it allows me to make many changes and gives me a clear vision of what I want and where I'm headed. After user testing, it’s much easier to change the prototype rather than having to delete large portions of code. Continuously updating and showing the prototype also helps track my progress, allowing me to see how far I've come from the beginning to the end of the project.

                    <p>The design of the landing page was initially created by Aleksa, and I continued working with the same theme. At first, the page featured an egg inside a CD, which I intended to use as an interactive "easter egg." The idea was that when clicked, it would reveal three options, and selecting the correct one would provide a discount for merchandise or concert tickets. However, after receiving feedback that the design didn’t need to include a literal easter egg and should instead connect more closely with the band, I began brainstorming alternative concepts. <br><br>

                        In the second version of the landing page, I included a "My Tickets" button. However, since the website was designed for a single event, having an account system was unnecessary. By the third version, I integrated a red CD with a portal leading to ticket purchases. After conducting user testing, my teacher pointed out that the spinning CDs were distracting and that users would prefer to see more information—such as the event location—before proceeding to buy tickets.<br><br>
                        
                        This feedback led to the final version of the landing page, which we later coded. The spinning CDs remained but were designed to focus user attention on them. A "Learn More" button was added, directing users to detailed event information. Initially, I planned to include a clickable content table for navigation but decided it would be too complex for users. Instead, I opted for a simpler design: an image containing all relevant information. The countdown feature was also incorporated alongside a prominent "Get Your Tickets" button.<br><br>
                        
                        For social media integration, I initially added a static image of their Instagram page but later pivoted to a more creative solution. While browsing Canva, I came across a gallery room concept and decided to recreate it in Blender for a visually engaging experience. Additionally, I developed supporting pages such as "About Us," "Location," and "FAQ."<br><br>
                        
                        During user testing with three participants, feedback on the spinning CDs from the landing page was particularly insightful. When Aleksa first presented the idea, I thought it would be engaging if hovering over them caused them to spin and play music. However, due to time constraints, only the spinning functionality was implemented.<br><br>
                        
                        Overall, this iterative process allowed me to refine the website's design and functionality based on user feedback and testing while ensuring it aligned with both user needs and the band's identity.

                    <p>for the photo booth because the 2 photo booths of Rhode and life4cut are popular so I decided to go with them and make an open-air photo booth to be easily adjusted wherever they want and also to give people memories from the group. Because people that like this type of music like vintage things and in Amsterdam the vintage photo booth is popular. I decided to have 2 options, the first one is to take a photo and have your ticket printed on the back and the second is to just have your photos with the theme of the posters I made with the group and in every event like Christmas you can take even a photo with the band that is dressed with a Christmas theme clothes. 
                        My teacher Anke didn’t like the idea with the printed tickets because this way you will attract more already fans of the band but I wanted to present the 2 options anyway, when I had a interview and user research I often was seeing people hang on their wall or put this kind of memories in their scrapbook or Travis Scott concerts and also Taylor Swift you get a bracelet handmade one that you can keep after the concert. 
                        I made a prototype just to show what can the photo booth looks like if they go with a normal one and one prototyped on my laptop for the open air one. I also made a prototype of the tickets how they can look like. The first picture of the tickets doesn’t have a template, but I showed it to my teacher, and he said to add something that will connect with the posters so after that I added 2 options that are with similar patterns as the posters me and my teammates made

                    <p>In the previous project, I felt that I did not conduct as many interviews as I would have liked, so for this project, I made it a priority to interview four users. During these interviews, I asked questions that would provide insights for the website, and afterward, I highlighted everything that would be useful for the design. The interviews were particularly helpful in determining the language for the website. Initially, I considered creating both English and Dutch versions, but most interviewees indicated that many people today understand English well enough that a separate Dutch version might not be necessary. They also mentioned that there are extensions available that can translate content automatically.

                        Additionally, the participants expressed that having a countdown timer and clear information about the event would be beneficial features. Interestingly, no one mentioned the idea of an easter egg as a necessary element; while they recognized it as a common feature on event websites, they felt it was not essential.
                        
                        The interviews were important in creating the website because they provided direct feedback from potential users. This feedback allowed me to focus on what features and information were truly important to them, ensuring that the final design would meet their needs and expectations effectively. By understanding their preferences and concerns, I could create a more user-friendly experience that resonates with the target audience.<a href="interview.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for interview pdf</a></p>

                    <p>For the development project I made an persona,which helped me design a better website for the Nasmak PM post-punk band by providing a clear understanding of the target audience's needs, preferences, and challenges. Personas allow you to step into the shoes of potential users, ensuring that the website aligns with their expectations and enhances their experience. I made two because the target audience is new generations but their fanbase is mostly 30s or 40s years old people, so the new generation persona will be good with technologies and they would want to have more socially involted features but the next persona not everyone are good with the technologies so having an user-friendly and easy usable website is important</p>

                        <p>For my portfolio, I wanted to create a 3D room that represents my actual room. Since this was my first time working with any 3D platforms, I started by searching for tutorials on YouTube to help me with the walls and floor. For the smaller details, I did some research to understand what each modifier does. I also made a sketch to map out exactly what I wanted to create. I decided not to use the original colors of my room, but instead, I chose colors from my own color palette.</p>

                        <p>This is a blob that was in one of the lectures with Mikael I followed the tutorial and as you can see in the picture this is the original code for the blob animation, I found it really easy and cool so I decided instead of boring circles to put 4 blobs and when I used the original code but just adjusting th style to replace the circles in my old portfolio it turned out actually really good and I was also thinking that the theme of my portfolio is more animation vibe so this effect really suited the portfolio theme.</p>

                        <p>I wanted to make my own logo and not just have my name but to have a meaning I decided to use the meaning of my short name “Miya” which means palace, or shrine in Japan. I used the shrine one because it will suit the Cherry blossom more. The cherry blossom is a traditional tree in Vietnam which is my nationality. I did AI images and ended up with this logo

                            2nd version sprint – I didn’t want to include my name I wanted the logo to have only the images the shrine and the cherry blossom because more logos have their name which is simple and every logo can be just the name but if you put the logo without the name maybe people will be more interest in why did you put exactly this is it because it gives you Asian vibes or there is a deeper meaning so it makes people curious that’s why I decided to leave only the cherry blossom and the shrine

I made posters for upcoming concerts, posters for their albums and also, I made a few posts for Instagram and highlights that can be used. Posts a lot of artists write down their songs on a vintage paper-like background and also they have handwrited typography with their posters and because the band wants crazy and chaotic vibe I made with the colours posters that have a lot of colours in one but I also made a clean posters and posts so that the 2 main colours are the first thing you see and that their Instagram feed can be really attractive.</p>

                        <p>To guide our design process, I created two style scapes: one with my teammates and another individually. Before doing the style scape, I researched what style scape should look like. Style scapes are visual representations that help define the aesthetic direction of a project.
                        Color and Typography Choices: For my style scape, I chose colors that resonate with our project's theme. Blue was selected for its association with doctor uniforms, while grey reflects nurse uniforms. Black and white were used for text to ensure clarity. For typography, I opted for fonts that enhance readability and lend a professional appearance to the design rather than childish

                        <p>After deciding which colour palette I want to chose i started making my stylescape, because the colours are pastel and the vibe is more childish i decided to go with some animations and also the typography is more bold and playful. When you look at the stylescape you can immediately imagine what kind of a person I am I also user test it with my friday teacher and she told me without me asking her that seeing the stylescape she just know what I like.</p>

                        <p>In collaboration with Aleksa, I produced a promo video inspired by TikTok trends. We used video clips from YouTube and the videos that Anke sent us to make an engaging narrative. The tools InShot and Canva were used in editing and finalizing the video. I gathered all the videos and saved them, then proceeded to choose the videos that are suitable for the video also I removed a lot of shots because I didn’t want the video to be too long. In my opinion, 30sec we’re perfectly fine. Me and Aleksa added background music from YouTube, and for the end result, we showed it to another teammate to see if we needed to adjust something.<a href="promo video.mov" target="_blank">Click here to see the promo video.</a></p>

                        <p>1. First stylescape: I think the contrast works well. The band's name is written in a way that gives off an '80s, disco, and vintage vibe. I added chaotic, nighttime-themed pictures to match the energy of their new event, *Dancing Night*. I also included images of a punk group performing live, to reflect the raw, energetic vibe of their music.

                            2. Second stylescape: This one is a totally different approach from the new wave style. It’s softer and more aligned with what I would call "white girl music." I wanted to include this to show the band a different direction and see if they’d be open to changing their style. Personally, as someone from this generation, I think soft colours like these would appeal to a lot of people today.
                            
                            3. Third stylescape: This is one of my favourites that I created. I stuck with their core colours—red and yellow—while also adding soft pink and dark purple. These colours pop a lot, especially on things like posters, and the red and yellow are a nod to their origins in a chicken coop. I thought it would be nice to keep that part of their history alive visually.
                            
                            4. Fourth stylescape: This is like the third one, but I swapped out the red and yellow for blue. I wanted to see how it would look with a different colour scheme.
                            
                            The feedback I received from the client is that they don't want to be perceived as a punk band, but rather as a new wave group. That’s why I made changes to some of the stylescapes to better reflect that identity.

                        <p>For my portfolio, I decided first to watch for inspiration on Pinterest, dribble, TikTok, and YouTube. I found a lot of portfolios that I wanted to make but in the end, I end up with the design that you will see later. After getting inspiration I decided to go to Colors.co and make my own color palette. I had 5 options and after imagining how the website can look I chose the last one because I wanted to have more soft and animated vibes. 
                            
                            At first I wanted my portfolio to have cactus vibes and to have little pink daisies but also to represent matcha colour too but when I was thinking of the design and when I made it I didn’t like it that much so I started making another colour palette
                             
                            
                            With the second colour palette I still wanted to do this vibe and try to fit different colours and maybe have a sky and a lot of cactuses but then I did Pinterest scrolling and decided to go for pastel colours or something more animated and also I wanted to be connected with my logo or somehow not distract you from the meaning of the logo then I came up with the 3rd version 
                            
                            The third version had rally strong blue and the pink and green didn’t really fit well because there were also 3 blue colours already so you can clearly see that it does not fit with the other colours and pink and green can feel overwhelmed by the blue colours so I wanted to have soft blue that’s why I gave up green because I won’t do cactus or matcha anyway 
                            
                             
                            
                            
                            With my end colour palette I saw that if every colour is that bright and soft the contrast won’t be really good also the text if its black it will be too strong and if it was white it will almost invisible so I putted purple more darkish but also give you a childish vibe then I putted pink and the sky blue I putted soft purple for the background of the hoover card and content table, with this purple the text can be pink or white it fits well both colours then I decided to make a small ai girl that has mine sweater hair and eyes and I putted in a circle

                        <p>First, I looked online to understand what a new wave punk band’s aesthetic is like. I explored their website and Instagram page to see the colors they typically use and the themes of their lyrics. I wanted to get a sense of what they sing about most often. After that, I went to TikTok to observe how fans of this type of music express themselves—how they dress, how their rooms are decorated, and what they like. I noticed that their style is heavily influenced by vintage items, with lots of bright colors and unique, unusual choices. Their rooms are filled with posters, concert tickets, lights, pictures, and drawings—often featuring a colorful or old-paper look.
                            For my mood board, I included an egg and chicken, symbolizing the origins of the band’s songwriting process. I also added an image of a girl with green hair, as many fans I saw have brightly colored hair. Overall, I found that the aesthetic is chaotic and vibrant, rather than clean and simple.
                            When I showed my teacher my posters, he mentioned that he prefers a more polished, one-color style and showed me examples of his work, which are very professional and well put together. However, I believe that professionalism doesn’t always mean clean and orderly. For a new wave punk band, the goal is to capture the raw, expressive energy of their style. If I were working with this band, I would want to create posters that reflect my own interpretation of their aesthetic, embracing the chaotic and bold vibe that defines their look and sound.

                        <p>New wave is a music genre that encompasses pop-oriented styles from the 1970s through the 1980s. It is considered a lighter and more melodic "broadening of punk culture
                            "New wave music is a broad subgenre of rock 'n' roll that combines elements of punk rock, mainstream pop music, art rock, synth pop, funk, and reggae.<br><br>
                           
                           Because the band mentioned that they want to attract a younger generation, I did some research on what new generation actually likes and what is trendy nowadays. I started by looking at the overall most popular and trendy things. One example I came across was the “Rhode” photo booth that Hailey Bieber created in London to promote her new lip gloss. With each photo taken in the booth, people received a lip gloss, and thousands of people queued up from morning till night to take a picture. The "Life4Cut" photo booth, which is really popular among K-pop fans, also caught my attention. People can take photos with the theme of their favorite K-pop bands, and it draws huge crowds.<br><br>
                           
                           
                           Another trend that’s really popular is Spotify. Almost everyone uses it now, and most people won’t listen to music unless it’s available on Spotify because they rarely want to install another app just to listen to a single song. The band already has their music on Spotify, but to make it even more popular, many people have the code to scan and go directly to the music.<br><br>
                           
                           Looking at the Instagram pages of some of the most popular singers, like Travis Scott and Central Cee, who are really popular among the younger generation, I noticed a few trends. Their Instagram feeds often feature two main colors that pop when you see the photo, and the feed usually has 9 photos in total. They also use handwritten fonts and old paper-like posts, and often share behind-the-scenes moments.<br><br>
                           
                           For people into new wave, punk, and similar music genres, I researched TikTok and found that this group also likes vintage products. Their color palette tends to lean towards brownish tones or chaotic mixes of neon colors, with red and yellow being especially popular. Interestingly, every girl I interviewed, even those into this style of music, mentioned they like pink, but there was a split—some prefer hot pink, while others like a softer shade of pink.

                        <p>I also made a prototype of the tickets how they can look like.One side is the ticket and the other is the photo frame with the theme and colour of the posters me and my team made.At first the photo frame was only with a logo but my techer told me it would be nice to be able to have photos without buying a ticket so I liked the idea and end up putting a colourful frame.</p>

                        <p>For the Spotify keychain, I designed a prototype featuring the Nasmak group poster with plus and minus icons. My idea was to have these keychains available at the stand-up booth, so that whenever someone buys a drink, they also get a keychain. Alternatively, they could be sold as "merch" after the concert. The Spotify keychain is really practical because it allows people to scan the code and immediately access the band's songs, rather than having to search for the group manually. If someone recommends the band to someone else, they’re less likely to search it up later. However, if you give them the keychain, they'll be more likely to scan the code out of curiosity and check out the music right away.</p>

                        <p>For their Instagram feed, I suggested posting BTS (behind the scenes) reels after every concert, but we didn't end up using that idea. For the Instagram feed I designed, I used the 9-photo method with 2 main colours that pop and are eye-catching. Having a well themed feed like this can attract more people. For the posters, I suggested they post them as stories and upload them a week before the concert. Including all the relevant links in the bio section for links is helpful rather than putting it in the bio but as a text, and creating a personalized hashtag would allow fans to follow and easily find their content. I also recommended creating a channel to engage with their fans and attract people interested in that genre of music. In this channel, the band could text their fans daily, post little vlogs or updates, and interact more directly with them—rather than just posting a generic picture of what they are eating with the caption "Happy." Underneath there are 9 pictures of the first 9 photos that they can post with yellow and red dominating. (all the pictures used, without the 4th one, are all the band’s pictures and my own posters)<a href="HTTPS://WWW.CANVA.COM/DESIGN/DAGV4CLXCCS/WBQSIWSI273XE_PYSKI9LW/EDIT?UTM_CONTENT=DAGV4CLXCCS&UTM_CAMPAIGN=DESIGNSHARE&UTM_MEDIUM=LINK2&UTM_SOURCE=SHAREBUTTON

                        <p>For analysis, I examined websites like Ticketmaster, Imagine Dragons' website, and StubHub. In the photo, I circled everything that I would like to include in my website. These websites are for events and concerts, and there are several pieces of information that each of them includes. Ticketmaster is the most popular, and I got the design for the location and some ideas from there. They also had a countdown, which I made sure to include as well. Since our client's website is for one specific event, I didn't include categories or other tabs but rather included everything in one scrollable page for easier navigation.</p>

                        <p>The Trello board really helped me because it provides a clear plan of what needs to be done each day. Adding deadlines motivates you more than saying "we have time." I used a color-coded agenda, which I found effective in previous first-semester team projects. I also assigned tasks so Aleksa and I knew what we would do individually, avoiding duplication of effort. However, plans don't always go as expected. I was sick on Thursday and Friday and couldn't do anything, so we started coding late and had to adjust the Trello board to ensure I could complete everything on time.</p>

With every task, there were people assigned and deadlines too so we could have in mind when to start. </p>

After brainstorming, I just had to place the ideas in the right categories. We put in "Must Have" the elements that every event website has and the features we knew we could implement in the given time frame. In "Should Have," we included additional desirable features. The spotify preview and the number of bought tickets we putted in could have because it was not really needed and if we had time we would have do it. We put language switch and sign up profile in "Won't Have because we found it unnecessary and also we were thinking like that because of the interviews.</p>

                        This semester, my goal was to explore all the possibilities in ICT Media Design, because I wanted to get a clearer view of what I want to do one day. I have been looking at tutorials online to improve my HTML and CSS skills and I have also been using AI to help me in my codes. One thing I really loved was 3D modeling with Blender, and that is why I decided to do something with that for Project X. I still don't know what exactly job I want to have yet, but I think by discovering more and more I will eventually find my path.</p>
