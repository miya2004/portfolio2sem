                                <p>In my previous project, I felt I didn't conduct as many interviews as I wanted. For this project, I interviewed four people, asking questions that would help me with the website design. I highlighted everything that I planned to use in the website from these interviews. The interviews also helped me decide on the language for the website. I was considering both English and Dutch versions, but most interviewees said that nowadays, many people know English, so a Dutch version isn't really necessary. They also mentioned that there are extensions that can translate automatically. The interviewees emphasized that a counter and clear information for the event are important to have. No one specifically mentioned an Easter egg, though they agreed it would be nice to have.<a href="interview.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the interviews</a> </p>

                                <p>This page is my inspiration for the application page and it turned out really good, the things I changes is that I made the square in the Bart’s hospital an rectangle and moved it under my text and add 2 options to apply and 1 button to contact us for further questions</p>

                                <p> Overall, the analysis helped me create the website prototype for the client. I chose to focus on both tech inspirations and healthcare, as my assignment was to develop branding. I didn't want to alter their structure of studying, so all the information in the prototype comes from Fonty's website and Bart's Hospital.<br><br>
        
                                I have circled the elements I used in my prototype in red. For more detailed information, you can refer to my PDF document.

                                <p>For analysis, I examined websites like Ticketmaster, Imagine Dragons' website, and StubHub. In the photo, I circled everything that I would like to include in my website. These websites are for events and concerts, and there are several pieces of information that each of them includes. Ticketmaster is the most popular, and I got the design for the location and some ideas from there. They also had a countdown, which I made sure to include as well. Since our client's website is for one specific event, I didn't include categories or other tabs but rather included everything in one scrollable page for easier navigation</p>

                                <p>Because the band mentioned that they want to attract a younger generation, I did some research on what new generation actually likes and what is trendy nowadays. I started by looking at the overall most popular and trendy things. One example I came across was the “Rhode” photo booth that Hailey Bieber created in London to promote her new lip gloss. With each photo taken in the booth, people received a lip gloss, and thousands of people queued up from morning till night to take a picture. The "Life4Cut" photo booth, which is really popular among K-pop fans, also caught my attention. People can take photos with the theme of their favorite K-pop bands, and it draws huge crowds.</p>

                                <p>Another trend that’s really popular is Spotify. Almost everyone uses it now, and most people won’t listen to music unless it’s available on Spotify because they rarely want to install another app just to listen to a single song. The band already has their music on Spotify, but to make it even more popular, many people have the code to scan and go directly to the music.</p>

                                <p>Looking at the Instagram pages of some of the most popular singers, like Travis Scott and Central Cee, who are really popular among the younger generation, I noticed a few trends. Their Instagram feeds often feature two main colors that pop when you see the photo, and the feed usually has 9 photos in total. They also use handwritten fonts and old paper-like posts, and often share behind-the-scenes moments.</p>

The platform of the game, where the player steps or runs, was designed in Figma using rectangles and circles because I couldn't find a program to generate it automatically. The ice creams represent coins that the player must collect, while the bunnies serve as enemies that must be avoided.</p>

This design was later changed based on feedback to connect more closely with the band.

The hover cards was unchanged idea from the start the only thing that was changed was small details for the structure but that you can see in the other learning outcomes (LO3) <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/laQ0VktWomqAnU5Io4ieT1/Untitled?node-id=314-195&t=fYpCT43tzhqtvUHh-0" target="_blank"> click here to see figma prototype</a></p>

                                    <p>I tested the website with 3 people and show it to techers. My UX friday techer told me that she would like before buying tickets there should be information first and to put the countdown more below because she would usually want to see the countdown after deciding if she will go and also "to buy tickets" option was in the landing page but because of the spinning circles she told me that she will be distracted and wont pay attenction a lot to the sign to buy a tickets so i thought she was right and put it in the countdown section, the other people got to test the newest version and they seemed to like it very much everything was structured but I got a comment that the date don't match and that the instagram post are not matching but i explained that the instagram post i wanted to use the instagram i remade for them and that the dates are just a mistake, also they said that the cds would be cool to have music or some kind of sound because just spinning around doesn't make sense. the user test really helped me and I found it really important to test it first and later on develop it because my friday techer really did have a point and it was a really helpful feedback later on I structured the website in easy way so the other users can have it easy using the event website </p>

                                    <h4 class="green-headline">User test 2</h4>
                                    <p>After the project ended, I conducted a user test with five people to ensure the website I created for the Nasmak PM Band was both interactive and user-friendly. My main goal was to make the website as enjoyable as possible for the target audience, ensuring they understood the structure and found it easy to use.<br><br>
                                        For the first task, I gave them two versions of the website: one with the ticket customization option and one without. As they were scrolling and buying tickets, I noticed that when they reached the step to customize their tickets, they had big smiles. One of the testers, a 23-year-old woman who enjoys this type of music, even asked me to send her the customized ticket after the test. When they tested the version without this option, they mentioned that it felt like any other generic website and was more plain. This confirmed to me that the ticket customization feature added a unique, engaging element to the website.<br><br>
                                        The second task focused on an "Easter egg" feature I had added to the event page. I wanted to see if users could understand why it was an Easter egg and how it was connected to the rest of the site. I first tested this feature with my manager, who enjoys similar music, but she didn’t immediately understand its purpose. I explained it to her, but my goal was to see if users could figure it out on their own. One user mentioned that if there was going to be an Easter egg, it would be better if it related more directly to the band or the event itself. He suggested something more obvious, like incorporating the band’s face or something related to their music. If I had more time with the project, I’d consider making something like a Pac-Man feature with the band’s face or an interactive element tied to their music.<br><br>
                                        The third task was to test if users understood the website structure and if it was easy to navigate. During my first user test with my teacher Jo An, she told me that the website structure wasn’t very clear, and I needed to make some changes. After applying her feedback, I tested the revised version with my participants and found that most of them preferred the updated version. They appreciated that it wasn’t as cluttered and that the steps were more clearly defined. However, I received feedback about the Instagram section, where users didn’t understand it and suggested adding a headline to clarify that it was the Instagram section. They also didn’t understand the spinning CDs and expected them to play music.<br><br>
                                        After gathering all this feedback, I realize that my new version of the website would look quite different, but I can now see how crucial these user tests are for refining the design. It’s been a valuable learning experience, and I now understand why it's important to have these steps in place before finalizing a project.

                                    <h4 class="green-headline">User Test Game</h4>
                                    <p>For Project X, I tested the prototype with two of my friends from Fontys and my boyfriend, as they play a lot of games and fit my target audience. I showed them an early version of the game that wasn’t fully finished but included all the necessary features for testing.
                                        I presented several versions of the game, each with different variables like the speed of the player and the enemy, as well as the placement of the platforms. My friends from Fontys provided feedback on the jumping function, saying that it was hard to play and that the size of the enemies felt strange. My boyfriend also commented that the enemies were too fast, which made me unsure about whether I should adjust their speed. To get a clearer answer, I tested it with another friend, who confirmed that the enemies were indeed too fast.
                                        This feedback helped me finalize my decision, and I now feel confident about the changes I need to make. The user test gave me the insights I needed to improve the game’s overall experience.

                                    <h4 class="green-headline">Photobooth</h4>
                                    <p>For the photo booth, I chose to go with two popular options—Rhode and Life4Cut—because they are widely appreciated. I decided to make an open-air photo booth, which can be easily adjusted to different locations. This way, it would also allow people to create memories with the group. I noticed that people who enjoy this type of music are often drawn to vintage aesthetics, and in Amsterdam, vintage photo booths are quite popular.<br>
                
                                        To cater to this, I decided to offer two options for the photo booth experience. The first option allows guests to take a photo with a ticket printed on the back, while the second option would simply provide photos featuring the theme of the posters I created for the group. At each event, such as Christmas, people could even take a photo with the band dressed in Christmas-themed clothing.<br>
                                        
                                        My teacher Anke didn't like the idea of the printed tickets, as she believed it would primarily attract fans who are already familiar with the band. However, I wanted to present both options anyway. During interviews and user research, I noticed that people often hang up such memories on their walls or put them in scrapbooks. At events like Travis Scott or Taylor Swift concerts, fans receive handmade bracelets to keep as a souvenir. This trend influenced my decision to include the ticket printing option.<br>
                                        
                                        I created a prototype to show what the photo booth could look like, with one version representing the traditional booth and another designed for the open-air setup. Additionally, I designed a prototype for the tickets themselves. The first image of the tickets did not include any template, but when I showed it to my teacher, he suggested adding elements that would connect with the posters. Afterward, I made two versions of the tickets that feature similar patterns to the posters my teammates and I had created.</p>

                                    <p>For the Spotify keychain, I designed a prototype featuring the Nasmak group poster with plus and minus icons. My idea was to have these keychains available at the stand-up booth, so that whenever someone buys a drink, they also get a keychain. Alternatively, they could be sold as "merch" after the concert. The Spotify keychain is really practical because it allows people to scan the code and immediately access the band's songs, rather than having to search for the group manually. If someone recommends the band to someone else, they’re less likely to search it up later. However, if you give them the keychain, they'll be more likely to scan the code out of curiosity and check out the music right away.</p>

These tutorials provided a solid foundation for the initial stages of the project.<br><br> For the smaller details of the room, I conducted further research to understand what each modifier does in the 3D modeling software. This allowed me to add complexity and realism to the design without feeling overwhelmed.<br><br> While I initially considered using the original colors of my room, I decided to experiment with colors from my own color palette instead. This choice allowed for a more personalized and creative interpretation of the space.<br><br> I didn't finish or do more for the blender room because I was overwhelmed with the projects and the portfolio band didn't organise my time well so for the next time I will make sure to plan more ahead.</p>

As shown in the image, this is the original code used to generate the blob effect. I found the process to be both easy and cool, which inspired me to experiment further. <br><br> -	Instead of using the standard circles, I decided to add 4 blobs for a more dynamic and unique effect. By adjusting the original code and customizing the style, I was able to replace the circles from my previous portfolio design. The results were surprisingly good and added an engaging visual element.<br><br> -	As I reflected on the overall theme of my portfolio, I realized that it leans heavily towards an animation vibe. The blob animation perfectly complemented this theme, enhancing the overall interactive experience and visual appeal of the portfolio</p>

My teacher specifically requested that the counter be simple, with minimal coding and without the help of AI.I successfully created the counter, following the given guidelines, and then hosted it on GitHub. After completing the project, I sent the link to my teacher for feedback.

                                <p>When I heard that I need to include easter egg i thought that there should be an actual easter egg somewhere and I was so confused because it didn't make any sense but then I realised that easter egg is not what i thought it is. Me and Aleksa were brainstorming for the easter egg and at first we wanted it to be a game where you need to guess which egg is the winner at to get 30% discount but then because the band started in a chicken coop and their moto is "escape from reality" we decided to make a floating egg that you need to catch and when you do it cracks, its floating like you are floating in space</p>

                                <p>When designing the event website, I knew that a countdown would be a crucial element. After reviewing several event websites, I realized that a countdown is something that almost every event-related site includes. It felt like a natural and essential feature for an event website, as it creates a sense of anticipation and urgency.<br><br>In the initial prototype, the countdown was quite plain. However, I felt that it lacked the visual interest and energy needed to stand out on the page. To make it more engaging, I decided to add some playful details.<br><br>To liven up the countdown, I introduced floating plus (+) and minus (-) signs. These small animations added movement and interactivity, making the countdown more dynamic. I also ensured that these signs matched the color scheme of the website, using red and yellow to align with the overall theme and aesthetic.

After discussing it with him, he helped me create the Kirby face animation. I also took the time to design the face in a way that would align with the overall theme of my portfolio, making it both fun and cohesive.<br><br>I wanted to include the Kirby face animation in my portfolio because it represented a learning milestone.

This would allow users to interact with the feature in a more personalized way, adding a unique touch to the site.<br><br>To avoid messing up the original design of the Nasmak PM website, I created a separate HTML file to test the new design ideas. This allowed me to experiment freely without affecting the main layout. The result looked great on the separate page, and I was happy with the customization options I added. </p>

They had a very effective and visually appealing way of displaying their Instagram feed.

                                <p>After designing the game in Figma, I moved on to coding. I used tutorials from YouTube and also received help from AI. The AI was particularly useful with the images, as the tutorial I was following had a method I couldn’t quite implement on my own. Whenever I encountered errors, I also asked AI for assistance. However, I couldn't rely on AI for all of the errors, so I turned to my development teacher for help when I hit more complex issues.<br><br>The player Is the astronaut boy, the bunnies are the enemies, whenever the player touch the bunnies the game restarts and whenever you fell from a platform the game also restarts.

Through this process, I learned a lot about JavaScript, which was my main goal for this project. If I had more time, I would have completed a full version of the game. However, this project has been an important step for me, as I plan to design and develop games in the future. It may be a small step, but it’s a valuable one toward achieving my goals.</p>

So, I decided to base the design on the meaning of my short name, "Miya", which translates to palace or shrine in Japanese.<br><br>I chose to focus on the shrine meaning of "Miya" because I felt it would blend more harmoniously with the theme of the cherry blossom. The cherry blossom is a traditional tree in Vietnam, my homeland, and it holds cultural significance. Combining these two elements, the shrine and the cherry blossom, created a design that was both meaningful and personal.<br><br>I used AI-generated images to help bring my vision to life, and after experimenting, I arrived at the second version of the logo. This version represented a cleaner, more symbolic design that focused on the images themselves, without including my name.</p>

                                        <p>First, I looked online to understand what a new wave punk band's aesthetic is like. I explored their website and Instagram page to see the colors they typically use and the themes of their lyrics. I wanted to get a sense of what they sing about most often. After that, I went to TikTok to observe how fans of this type of music express themselves—how they dress, how their rooms are decorated, and what they like. I noticed that their style is heavily influenced by vintage items, with lots of bright colors and unique, unusual choices. Their rooms are filled with posters, concert tickets, lights, pictures, and drawings—often featuring a colorful or old-paper look. For my mood board, I included an egg and chicken, symbolizing the origins of the band's songwriting process. I also added an image of a girl with green hair, as many fans I saw have brightly colored hair. Overall, I found that the aesthetic is chaotic and vibrant, rather than clean and simple. When I showed my teacher my posters, he mentioned that he prefers a more polished, one-color style and showed me examples of his work, which are very professional and well put together. However, I believe that professionalism doesn't always mean clean and orderly. For a new wave punk band, the goal is to capture the raw, expressive energy of their style. If I were working with this band, I would want to create posters that reflect my own interpretation of their aesthetic, embracing the chaotic and bold vibe that defines their look and sound.</p>

                        <p>For the Blender project, I wanted to create an animated version of my room back in Bulgaria.

Since I’m new to Blender, I started watching YouTube tutorials, which made me feel excited and motivated to dive into 3D design.</p>

This would create an additional incentive for fans to engage with the band's music both during and after the event.<br></br> What makes the Spotify keychain practical is its ability to provide immediate access to the band's songs. By scanning the embedded QR code, fans can directly link to the band's Spotify profile and start listening right away, eliminating the need to search for the band manually.   </p>

                            -	In collaboration with Aleksa, I worked on producing a promo video inspired by popular TikTok trends. The goal was to create an engaging narrative that captured the attention of the audience quickly, aligning with the fast-paced, creative style of TikTok videos.<br><br>
                            -	Gathering and Selecting Footage<br>
                            -	We started by collecting video clips from YouTube and the footage Anke sent us. I took responsibility for gathering and organizing all the clips. After reviewing the footage, I carefully selected the most relevant clips that fit our narrative. I also removed several shots to keep the video concise and impactful, ensuring that it wouldn’t feel too long. In my opinion, a 30-second duration was perfect for this type of promo video.<br><br>
                            -	Editing and Finalizing the Video<br>
                            -	We used InShot and Canva as our editing tools. These platforms allowed us to edit the clips, add transitions, and finalize the video. Together with Aleksa, we also added background music sourced from YouTube to enhance the video’s energy and flow.<br><br>
                            -	Team Feedback and Final Adjustments<br>
                            -	Once the video was complete, we shared the final version with another teammate to get feedback. Based on their input, we made any necessary adjustments to ensure that the video was polished and met the expectations.

                <p>To guide our design process, I created two style scapes: one with my teammates and another individually. Before doing the style scape, I researched what style scape should look like. Style scapes are visual representations that help define the aesthetic direction of a project.</p>

                <p>After deciding on the color palette for the project, I began working on my stylescape. Since the colors I chose were pastel tones, they naturally conveyed a more childish and playful vibe. To complement this, I incorporated animations to bring energy to the design, further emphasizing the fun and lighthearted theme. <a href="second semester pdf document.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see more.</a></p>

                        <p>I think the contrast works well. The band's name is written in a way that gives off an '80s, disco, and vintage vibe. I added chaotic, nighttime-themed pictures to match the energy of their new album, <i>Dancing Night</i>. I also included images of a punk group performing live, to reflect the raw, energetic vibe of their music.</p>

                        <p>This one is a totally different approach from the new wave style. It’s softer and more aligned with what I would call "white girl music." I wanted to include this to show the band a different direction and see if they’d be open to changing their style. Personally, as someone from this generation, I think soft colors like these would appeal to a lot of people today.</p>

                        <p>This is one of my favourites that I created. I stuck with their core colors—red and yellow—while also adding soft pink and dark purple. These colors pop a lot, especially on things like posters, and the red and yellow are a nod to their origins in a chicken coop. I thought it would be nice to keep that part of their history alive visually.</p>

                        <p>The feedback I received from the client is that they don't want to be perceived as a punk band, but rather as a new wave group. So I didn't make changes to the stylescape but on my research later on I focused on new wave/post-punk aesthetics.</p>

                            design that you will see later. After getting inspiration I decided to go to Colors.co and make
                            my own color palette. I had 5 options and after imagining how the website can look I chose
                            the last one because I wanted to have more soft and animated vibes.

                        <p>Looking at the Instagram pages of some of the most popular singers, like Travis Scott and Central Cee, who are really popular among the younger generation, I noticed a few trends. Their Instagram feeds often feature two main colors that pop when you see the photo, and the feed usually has 9 photos in total. They also use handwritten fonts and old paper-like posts, and often share behind-the-scenes moments.</p>

                        <p>For their Instagram feed, I suggested posting BTS (behind the scenes) reels after every concert, but we didn't end up using that idea. For the Instagram feed I designed, I used the 9-photo method with 2 main colours that pop and are eye-catching. Having a well themed feed like this can attract more people.
                            Underneath there are 9 pictures of the first 9 photos that they can post with yellow and red dominating. (all the pictures used, without the 4th one, are all the band’s pictures and my own posters)</p>

                        <p> I also recommended creating a channel to engage with their fans and attract people interested in that genre of music. In this channel, the band could text their fans daily, post little vlogs or updates, and interact more directly with them—rather than just posting a generic picture of what they are eating with the caption "Happy."</p>

                        <p>After my last assessment, I received feedback to work on improving my design by adding images, paragraphs, and headlines. I was also advised to add titles to the blobs. For the design updates, I focused on updating the hover cards and succeeded in doing so for the project pages. However, the Learning Outcomes page remained largely unchanged because, when I tried to make adjustments, the file became so long that I got lost in the code. As a result, the page was crashing frequently, and with limited time left, I decided to focus on improving the styling where I could and make smaller adjustments.
                            Despite these challenges, I did manage to update the hover cards, and I got feedback on the new design from both Frank and Dirk. The progress was visible, and I felt more confident with the improvements I had made.

                                <p>First day I made a shared team charter so that everyone could write their details. I used a template from Canva. The team charter helped us assign the future tasks for the project</p>

                              <p>The Trello board really helped me because it provides a clear plan of what needs to be done each day. Adding deadlines motivates you more than saying "we have time." I used a color-coded agenda, which I found effective in previous first-semester team projects. I also assigned tasks so Aleksa and I knew what we would do individually, avoiding duplication of effort. However, plans don't always go as expected. I was sick on Thursday and Friday and couldn't do anything, so we started coding late and had to adjust the Trello board to ensure I could complete everything on time.</p>

                            <p>Second week after getting sad feedback from Anke I did a planning in Trello that was moved to Teams because my teammates preferred it. I did it in weeks because that helped me and the others to have a clear vision of what we have to do and when. With every task, there were people assigned and deadlines too so we could have in mind when to start.</p>

                      <p>The MoSCoW table was easy to create because we already had a vision of how the website should look. After brainstorming, I just had to place the ideas in the right categories. We put in "Must Have" the elements that every event website has and the features we knew we could implement in the given time frame. In "Should Have," we included additional desirable features. The spotify preview and the number of bought tickets we putted in could have because it was not really needed and if we had time we would have do it. We put language switch and sign up profile in "Won't Have because we found it unnecessary and also we were thinking like that because of the interviews.</p>

                    I had an assignment to complete the project plan first, but I started with brainstorming because I wanted to have everything prepared for the project plan. Since I had a photo booth as a product in the last project and needed to use something from our previous project, I initially thought about creating a landing page with a Blender-made photo booth.The AI vision concept was our second choice. Given that the band's motto is "escape from reality," Aleksa and I considered creating a website that looks like AI vision. However, we needed to focus more on the event rather than the band's website itself. I continued brainstorming other ideas while keeping in mind that we could still incorporate AI vision for the event website.

                    <p>In my previous project, I felt I didn't conduct as many interviews as I wanted. For this project, I interviewed four people, asking questions that would help me with the website design. I highlighted everything that I planned to use in the website from these interviews. The interviews also helped me decide on the language for the website. I was considering both English and Dutch versions, but most interviewees said that nowadays, many people know English, so a Dutch version isn't really necessary. They also mentioned that there are extensions that can translate automatically. The interviewees emphasized that a counter and clear information for the event are important to have. No one specifically mentioned an Easter egg, though they agreed it would be nice to have.<a href="interview.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the interviews</a> </p>

                                          <p>As part of the semester, we did a peer feedback table in Excel. I received feedback that I need to stand out more and take more initiative. I was also told that I need to improve my presentation skills because sometimes, if I seem uncertain, clients might doubt my work. This is something I definitely plan to work on. For the second project, I took on more of the presenting and tried my best to improve my delivery.</p>

This semester, I took steps in that direction by creating a brand for a healthcare innovation minor at Fontys, starting with Blender, and designing a game.</p>

                                                <p>Branding, in particular, interests me a lot because my parents own two bubble tea shops that serve Vietnamese cuisine. For one of the shops, I worked on creating Instagram posts, and when they first started the business, I designed the logo and chose the color palette.For the second shop I tried to recreate some of their already made posters and also came up with ideas about how they can attract more clients.

                                                <p>At the beginning of the semester, my goal was to seek more feedback and do more iterations. Looking back, I feel like I’ve accomplished that. One of the biggest iterations was the design of the hover card in my portfolio. I’ve also become more comfortable with receiving feedback—it’s not as intimidating anymore. Now, as I look at my portfolio, I can really see how it has evolved and improved.<br><br>

                                                    Talking with Jo An helped me being more confident for the work I have made so far, she told me that there will be always unfinished work and that I need to be proud of what I’ve done so far because it’s not a little
